| mev-explore | v0 | Jan 8 | @obadiaa | public dashboard with MEV and REV-related metrics |

## motivation
MEV Explore is a public dashboard we provide to the Ethereum community in order to understand Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) and Realized Extractable Value (REV) better. This effort fits within our ‘Illuminate’ objective as described in the initial [Flashbots EthResearch post](https://ethresear.ch/t/flashbots-frontrunning-the-mev-crisis/8251).

## objective
MEV Explore v0 **should** be easily understandeable by the average Ethereum user, get people excited about what we're working on, help us create a consistent narrative about the work we're doing and be a funnel for contributors to MEV-Inspect.

At this stage, it **should not**, serve as a power tool for traders and miners, require substantial pre-requisite knowledge to understand and overwhelm users with too much data or too many graphs

## timeline
* 30 Nov: team formation
* 7 Dec: Building
* 18 Dec: First draft ready for review
* 25 Dec: Review period ended
* 4 Jan: Explore v0 is out
* 7 Jan: Medium article on MEV-Explore and MEV trading strategies
* Post 8 Jan: To be defined

## contributors
* Tom Schmidt
* Jason Paryani
* Brock Elmore


## deliverables
* v0 of public dashboard
* blogpost on MEV-Explore and trading strategies [draft doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yYX48CYBPG7cn8yX_SzUZsrR4YaUtez2MnpXu1-Bgzc/edit?usp=sharing)
* md doc on Github detailing how the metrics are calculated

## project dependency: MEV-Inspect
MEV-Inspect is the underlying data used for this dashboard, the to-dos for this project will therefore also include Inspect. Here are tasks from Inspect, ranked by chronology and order of importance for Explore.

- developing a coverage metric [issue #28](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-inspect-rs/issues/28)
- adding more single-tx inspectors to Inspect
    - DyDx liquidations 
    - ESD clipper
    - TokenSets rebalances
    - Nexus Mutual rebalances
    - [add others]
- adding multi-tx inspectors to Inspect
- integrating mempool data?
- integrating CFF data [issue #29](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-inspect-rs/issues/29) and [issue #30](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-inspect-rs/issues/30)

## specification

At this stage, MEV Explore is essentially a DeFi trading dashboard. Explore v0 will be an [embedded Metabase dashboard](https://www.metabase.com/blog/external-facing-analytics/index.html) that is pointed to our own domain. Users won't be able to ask their own queries and they will only be able to read the data displayed to them. 

We want the metrics to tell a story and be ordered logically eg. so one can grasp what blockspace wasted means in this context.

**The current story is:**

1. Time-series of value extracted in USD
    * This is the size of the opportunity and how much it has grown over time in 2020.
    * Sum over time of the value extracted, normalized in USD using ETH daily and hourly price.


3. Total amount of value extracted in USD 
    * As of today, this is the total amount of value that has been extracted out of transaction prioritization.
    * The latest number from the graph above.


5. Split of the techniques employed for value extraction 
    * This value is mainly extracted through frontrunning and backrunning, and on a few key protocols. 
    * Breakdown of extraction by techniques and toggle by protocols.


7. Blockspace wasted 
    * Such extraction techniques are inefficient. This is how much blockspace would be saved if Flashbots was used.
    * Aggregate number of blocks wasted by these inefficient techniques.


9. Tx fees wasted 
    * Since blockspace is wasted, this also implies tx fees have been 'wasted', unecessarily pushing the price of gas up.
    * Block space wasted multiplied by (median gas price * ETH price for the block)?


11. Coverage figure 
    * These figures are lower bounds and we're improving coverage of the dashboard regularly by adding new protocols and strategies, help us get to 100% coverage!
    * A cross-reference of [issue #28](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-inspect-rs/issues/28) with Inspect data


13. Transaction feed
    * While we show numbers in aggregate, here is the stream of transactions that we analyze and here are individual high MEV tx opportunities, you can toggle between the latest, the highest value in the last 7d-30d-all time, the highest gas consumers and special transactions (MEV of the day) that are peculiar.
    * Feeding from Inspect data with some filtering, each tx linked to Etherscan.


15. MEV of the day
    * Peculiar transactions that have popped up while we run Inspect, some of them we thought were false positives, some of them are interesting in their behavior, some of them we can't explain!
    * Not sure how we arrive at this

## to dos

- write up SQL queries for dashboard (@Tom)
    - cumulative time-series SQL query
    - converting our total value extracted currently from Eth to USD (ask Scott best method there)
    - top opportunities past 7d, 30d, and all time
    - 'MEV of the day'

- figure out which transactions are in MEV of the day
(see section below with some example transactions)
What kind of heuristics do we use to display MEV of the day/week txs? 
Can we add any explainer text with them?

- write up explainer texts for each metrics that people can hover on/be directed to (@Alex)

- write up md explainer of metrics (@Alex)

- potentiall add a metric that covers Flashbots? (% of hashrate? Flashbots blocks mined? REV extracted through Flashbots?)

- put together coverage metric for inspectors (@Jason)

- route dashboard to domain (@Jason)

- write Medium post (@Alex)


## REV of the week/day

One solution offered by Georgios is to just display the tx with the highest REV for that week.

Below is a list of transactions we've shared in the past (mostly Scott and Georgios).

'here's another fun arbitrage, not sure where to classify it'
mint+sell GST2 if uniswap price + gas price being selected work out
arbitraging transaction-gas against GST2-ETH market

huh
so basically, find the market price for gst2 and discard any transactions with gas price lower than that
stuff your block with a mint+sell instead

ya looks like
153.5 ETH loan. Paid 12.67 ETH in fees + ~45 gas tokens
borrowed ETH bought UNI, uni deposited into compound to free up their WBTC, sold for ETH to repay ?
so the user is sitting on a compound position that is waiting in order to take orders they want? seems really, really bad way to run things. they paid a lot of gas at a large gas price, because they don't have 153 eth lying around?

Monster liquidation, And no flashloan
wait a second was this not profitable?
they got 9m USDC and they paid >$9M LINK

not bad
is that $58K for $400 fee

someone attempted to extract mev,
screwed it up, lost 230 ETH
also,
because they failed, they also paid twice as much,
since the refunds didn't apply



## open questions & roadblocks

* The story transition from value extracted to blockspace wasted is not very understandable, I'm wondering what we can do here while minimizing our use of text as much as possible. 
    * Tom: I'm thinking we can link a "?" out to like a Github gist with more info? or even another text-only dash

* Would we like to provide an API for more experienced users to play with the Inspect data?
 
* Is the current data and data structure of MEV-Inspect compatible with where we’d like MEV Explore to go?




## beyond v0

As we release Explore to the community, the dashboard will become a reflection of our efforts in Inspect. As we increase Inspect coverage, the dashboard metrics will become more and more valuable. 

The efforts in Inspect that are most relevant to Explore:
* adding more inspectors for single REV
* adding more inspectors for multi-tx REV
* adding state-space search models to go from extracted to extractable value metrics

As we iterate on v0 to display the right metrics and convey the right message, we plan on building a custom UI to go from embedded app to [fully hosted](https://www.metabase.com/blog/external-facing-analytics/index.html).

Some additional features and metrics we could add in the future:
* Generally more granularity, as Tom mentioned the idea with v0 is to start at H1 and gradually allow people to drill down as we build out those surfaces.
    * A ransaction explorer: instead of redirection people to Etherscan we could have our own tx explorer.
    * Letting people filter per strategy


**Open questions:**
* What kind of other metrics and analytics tools can we build on top of Explore? For who? (eg. miners, traders)
