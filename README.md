# Flashbots
Flashbots is a research and development organization formed to mitigate the negative externalities and existential risks posed by miner-extractable value (MEV) to smart-contract blockchains, starting with Ethereum. Our primary focus is to enable a *permissionless, transparent, and fair ecosystem* for MEV extraction.

Flashbots arose out of the *MEV Pi-rate Ship*, a neutral, chain-agnostic, interdisciplinary research collective that supports MEV-related theoretical and empirical research.

Flashbots research and development are tightly-coupled dual engines that propel Flashbots in a phased approach:
- **Long-term oriented research effort:** They spec out and update our roadmap, define our organizationâ€™s phases and identify key milestones associated with each of them;
- **Milestone-oriented engineering effort:** They are organized as product-focused teams that ship core infrastructure and ecosystem tools, while collecting data and producing other artifacts that feed back into research.

## MEV Roast
### Purpose
MEV Roast is a semi-monthly discussion that stems from the research collective MEV Pi-rate Ship tradition. It's meant to service as a communication bridge between Flashbots and the broader community interested in understanding MEV and contribute to our research and engineering efforts. The format of our Roast is meant to invite constructive criticism on the Flashbots efforts and to address open questions.
